                    Fixed guards must always be kept in place. These prevent
                    entanglement The guard should ensure that no part of your
                    body can reach the danger zone Fixed guarding of older
                    machines should be upgraded in line with the guarding on
                    newer models Do not use a machine unless all guards are in
                    place

                    Tractors and Machinery are the main cause of farm accidents
                    in Ireland. Elderly farmers and children are at particular
                    risk. Being entangled in PTOâ€™s, crushed under a machine
                    part, caught in a machine mechanism, crushed between
                    vehicles and struck by a machine object are the main causes
                    of deaths with farm machinery.
