                Fixed guards must always be kept in place. These prevent
                entanglement The guard should ensure that no part of your body
                can reach the danger zone Fixed guarding of older machines
                should be upgraded in line with the guarding on newer models Do
                not use a machine unless all guards are in place

                Tractors and Machinery are the main cause of farm accidents in
                Ireland. Elderly farmers and children are at particular risk.
                Being entangled in PTOâ€™s, crushed under a machine part, caught
                in a machine mechanism, crushed between vehicles and struck by a
                machine object are the main causes of deaths with farm
                machinery.
