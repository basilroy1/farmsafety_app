            Fixed guards must always be kept in place. These prevent
            entanglement The guard should ensure that no part of your body can
            reach the danger zone Fixed guarding of older machines should be
            upgraded in line with the guarding on newer models Do not use a
            machine unless all guards are in place

            Tractors and Machinery are the main cause of farm accidents in
            Ireland. Elderly farmers and children are at particular risk. Being
            entangled in PTOâ€™s, crushed under a machine part, caught in a
            machine mechanism, crushed between vehicles and struck by a machine
            object are the main causes of deaths with farm machinery.
